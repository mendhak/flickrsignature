Easy Flickr URL
===============

The aim is to allow for an easy to use URL that can get flickr images or flickr URLs.  The Easy URL takes a username and image number.  For example:

example.com/**mendhak/9/img/b**

This means: _For user **mendhak**, get the **9**th latest **image**, in size **big**._

example.com/**123452@N00/4/url**

This means:  _For user with NSID **123452@N00**, **redirect** me to the URL of their **4**th photo_


This has a few uses:

*  You can use JavaScript against your flickr images (slideshows, badges, etc) without revealing your API key
*  You can create badges, carousels, forum signatures such that they don't need to be updated
*  Since it's hosted on your server, you get better stats
