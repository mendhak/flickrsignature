The aim is to allow for an easy to use URL that can get flickr images or redirect to flickr URLs.  The format will be, roughly:

example.com/mendhak/9/img/o

This means: For user mendhak, get the 9th latest image, in original size.

example.com/123452@N00/4/url

This means:  For user with NSID 123452@N00, redirect me to the URL of their 4th photo
