Easy Flickr URL
==================

The aim is to allow for an easy to use URL that can get flickr images or flickr URLs.  The Easy URL takes a username and image number.  For example:

example.com/mendhak/9/img/b

This means: For user mendhak, get the 9th latest image, in size big.

example.com/123452@N00/4/url

This means:  For user with NSID 123452@N00, redirect me to the URL of their 4th photo


This can have a few uses:

*  You can use JavaScript against your flickr images (slideshows, badges, etc) without revealing your API key
*  You can create badges, carousels, forum signatures such that they don't need to be updated
